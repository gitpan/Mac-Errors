The scripts in this directory update ../lib/Errors.pm. They are driven
by make, though there is no actual compilation going on; it was just
easier to write it this way. The update happens in the following
steps:

1) header.txt and footer.txt are extracted from the current Errors.pm
2) The errors listed in the current Errors.pm are extracted into
   errors-old.dat (see depodify-errors).
3) Google is used to search the Apple Developer's web pages for any
   pages mentioning "result codes". This list of pages is placed in
   online-sources.dat (see download-sources).
4) The pages listed in online-sources.dat are downloaded and parsed
   into errors-online.dat (see download-errors).
5) The errors listed in errors-old.dat and errors-online.dat are
   combined into errors.dat. Conflicts are resolved by consulting
   errors-exceptions.dat (which is created by hand). If any unresolved
   conflicts are detected, the process aborts here with suggestions about
   what to add to errors-exceptions.dat (see combine-errors).
6) The errors listed in errors.dat are formatted as part of a POD
   document called errors.txt (see podify-errors).
7) header.txt, errors.txt, and footer.txt are combined into
   Errors.pm.new.

Of course, all you really need to do is:

cd src
make update
mv ../lib/Errors.pm.new ../lib/Errors.pm

And you're on your way.
